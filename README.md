# K-Means-Clustering-from-Scratch
The main objective of the K-Means algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the points and their respective cluster centroid.
Clustering is the process of dividing the entire data into groups (also known as clusters) based on the patterns in the data.
Step 1: Choose the number of clusters k
Step 2: Select k random points from the data as centroids
Step 3: Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid
Step 4: Recompute the centroids of newly formed clusters
Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4
